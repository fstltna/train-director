This scenario shows how to use scripts associated with tracks.
<p>
Two tracks have scripts associated with them.<br>
The first script shows how to automatically clear a signal<br>
to let the train proceed. The second shows some messages<br>
in the alert window as the state of the track changes.
<p>
<h3>Description of the activity</h3>
<p>
Let T1 enter. When T1 reaches the first track of length 500m<br>
it will automatically clear the first signal.<br>
As the signal changes to green, the next track becomes<br>
busy, and so it prints an appropriate message in the alert window.<br>
As T1 reaches the middle track of length 500m, it causes<br>
more messages to be printed, as the train enters and leaves the track.
<p>
After the train has exited the territory, try clearing<br>
and closing the first signal. You'll see how the middle track<br>
reacts as it prints the corresponding message.
