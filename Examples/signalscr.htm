The signalscr.trk scenario is a very simple example<br>
of how to create customized signals using scripts.<br>
The leftmost signal is associated with the rfi_avv.tds<br>
file. This script describes the behavior of an advance<br>
signal as defined by RFI (the Italian Railroad Infrastructure<br>
Company). The script tells the signal to change its aspect<br>
based on the condition of the next signal and of the<br>
switch after the next signal.
<p>
As you clear the protection signal to let T1 go to B, you'll<br>
see that the advance signal automatically becomes green.<br>
Once you throw the switch and clear the protection signal<br>
to let T2 go to C, you'll see the advance signal to<br>
start flashing.
