This scenario shows how to use scripts associated with Trains.
<p>
The scripts associated with the 3 trains will print some messages<br>
in the alert window, as each train triggers different events.
<p>
<h3>Description of the activity</h3>
<p>
Let T1 enter and let it stop at the first signal.<br>
Then clear the signal and let T1 arrive at S1 and later
at S2.
<br>
Assign T1 to T2.
<br>
Let T2 exit via B. Meanwhile, T3 will enter and arrive at T1.
<br>
Reverse T3's direction, and then shunt it out of the territory.
<p>
Also, T1's departure from S1 can be randomly delayed
by 60 seconds.
